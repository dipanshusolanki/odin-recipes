    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        Rich, slightly sweet, and perfectly balanced with a splash of zingy fresh lime juice, a classic Dark ‘N' Stormy goes down very easy. It’s so good in fact, that Goslings, (the company that makes Black Seal Rum and the canned ginger beer) trademarked the drink in 1991. As such, to be able to legally call your drink a Dark ‘N' Stormy, you must use Gosling’s Black Seal Rum. In truth, your favorite dark rum will work just fine.
